## Hey there!

I'm a fresh new grad from McGill University up in the great north.
I started my degree in Linguistics, but gradually pivoted to Computer Science, where I graduated with a 3.8 CGPA and distinctions.
I'm a boundlessly curious person with special interests in math, AI, FP and linguistics. I love learning autonomously by reading textbooks, papers, and following specialists online on Youtube and Twitter.
My experience includes:
- undergraduate AI research with MILA and Microsoft FATE, exploring ethical issues in the automatic summarization domain
- startup ML and full-stack work with Phamily, a HealthTech communication platform for chronic care practitioners
- FAANG work at Amazon, where I worked under the Customer Behavior Analytics org to create a new data ingestion and onboarding pipeline

I'm trying to learn as much as I can, and hopefully find a company that allows me to grow and contribute meaningfully to a project I care about!
